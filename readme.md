# My Portfolio
_ _ _


### Inspiration

Honestly I am not sure what my inspiration for the design of my portfolio would be. I chose the colors because my favorite color is blue. I also know that both dark and light grays go well with blue shades. I also prefer simple layouts that don't look clutered or unorganized. Simple and clean look best to me.

### Content

For the home page I wanted to provide a bit of detail about myself and who I am. Since this is portfolio I also wanted to provide some insight into both my professional and educational experiences which may set me apart from others.

For my other pages, I chose to follow the design but only include certain types of media. Since I am most interested in web design and development, the web design page was first and then graphic design then photography. For the most part only my web design page contains projects that were done professionally for a client where as both graphic design and photography was for fun.

### Tools and outside resources

In the beginning I primarily used JetBrains WebStorm as my main development environment. Since it can be a pain to constantly refresh your browser to see your updates I eventually moved over to codepen and tested mostly in Chrome and Firefox.

Some of the outside resources I used are Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Ionicons, and Fancybox.
